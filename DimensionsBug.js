This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions on Android.  The issue is that `Dimensions.get('window')` might return `undefined` during certain lifecycle events, especially early in the component's mount process or if the screen orientation changes rapidly. This leads to unexpected behavior or crashes when trying to access properties like `width` and `height`.
